apint_add, apint_sub for unsigned integers
initial hex code to help apint_sub and apint_add pass unit tests

Maudeline Deus worked on:
apint_add, apint_sub and units tests for both of these as well, lots of work with overflow, underflow, and edge cases

apint_destroy and valgrind issues
apint_is_zero, apint_is_negative, apint_get_bits, apint_highest_bit_set, apint_negate, apint_compare
added signed integers to apint_add, apint_sub
wrote test cases for apint_add, apint_sub, apint_is_negative, apint_is_zero

Alexis Sanehia worked on for MS2:
apint_highest_bit_set, apint_create_from_hex (small and large), apint_format_as_hex (small and large), apint_compare, units tests for these functions as well.
